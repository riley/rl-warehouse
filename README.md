# RileyLife warehouse SOAP wrapper

this api is a piece of shit. There is a poorly implemented SOAP service made by a third party which RL uses to track inventory.

I tried to make a wrapper that will make working with RL slightly less terrible.

## Release Notes - December 7, 2014
- removed callbacks and replaced with Promises
